## Screenshot of the Webpage

The following image shows the screenshot of the webpage (please read the note part):

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/Screenshot.png)

> **Note**: Ideally, this webpage should looks exactly like the mock-up from the module 1 challenge introduction. But when I take the screenshot, the developer tool take some part of the screen so the webpage have to shrink a little bit. This is why some part on the webpage shown on the screenshot doesn't look quite right. But when you actually view the webpage, please zoom in or out a little bit on your broswer, you should see the webpage looks exactly like the mock-up one.
